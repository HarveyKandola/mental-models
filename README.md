# Mental models

I read ["Mental models i find repeatedly useful"](https://medium.com/@yegg/mental-models-i-find-repeatedly-useful-936f1cc405d#.ngjmxnx5x) by the great [Gabriel Weinberg](https://twitter.com/yegg) from [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) and loved the post. I highly recommend you read that post. It is awesome.

I though it would be pretty cool to memorize the list myself, but reading the post over and over again seemed a bit boring. I really like using [Anki](http://ankisrs.net) (please update that icon!) to memorize new things and I though I could turn the post into an Anki deck. Using this [custom Markdown format](https://gist.github.com/marcelinollano/de710e3d3665162ac752) I produced a deck that you can use with Anki.

In the question you can see the in parenthesis the category and the frequency number just like the post explains:

> The numbers next to each mental model reflect the frequency with which they come up: 
>  (1) - Frequently (62 models). 
>  (2) - Occasionally (40 models). 
>  (3) - Rarely, though still repeatedly (84 models).

## How to install

1. Download, install and open [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/#download)
2. [Download the deck]()
3. Double click the deck and the mental models deck should appear.

## Credits

I own nothing, all credit goes to [Gabriel Weinberg](https://twitter.com/yegg) and his great post. Also, I am not affiliated in any way with [Anki](http://ankisrs.net), I just like using it and I recommend it.
